# Photosynthesis Simulation
## About
Photosynthesis Simulation is a p5.js simulation modeling how the magnitude of light, the color of light, and the amount of carbon dioxide affect the rate of photosynthesis of an aquatic plant. 
The simulation can be found [here](https://editor.p5js.org/saphiooo/sketches/kZljxoxkQ). The variables for the simulation are editable; users are encouraged to interact with the code to use the simulation. 

This works best on computers, desktops, or tablets (landscape orientation), due to the structure of the user interface.
